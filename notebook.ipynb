The flat Winston lives in is seven flights up, with a poster of an enormous face with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" at each landing. The flat has a telescreen that cannot be completely shut off, and Winston keeps his back turned to it for safety. The building itself is described as grimy, and the surroundings include rotting nineteenth-century houses with patched windows and sagging garden walls. The Ministry of Truth, a vast white structure, towers above the landscape from a distance.'"
